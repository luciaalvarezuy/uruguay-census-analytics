# Uruguay Census Big Data & Machine Learning Project

## Overview  
This repository contains an ongoing, end-to-end **data science project** built to explore, process, and model large-scale census data from **Uruguay** using **PySpark**.  
It is a work in continuous development, designed to showcase real-world skills in **big data processing**, **ML experimentation**, and **production-ready data pipelines**.

The goal is to demonstrate how I approach complex data problems from a full lifecycle perspective:  
**ingestion → cleaning → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → iteration.**

---

## Project Goals  
- Process and analyze large datasets with **PySpark** in a scalable framework  
- Build clean, modular, reproducible data pipelines  
- Perform in-depth EDA and feature engineering  
- Train and compare Machine Learning models (classification, regression, clustering)  
- Apply best practices in version control, documentation, and project structure  
- Iterate continuously as new insights and improvements arise  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**, **PySpark**, **MLlib**, **scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib/Seaborn**  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**  
- **Git & GitHub**

---

##  Key Highlights  
- Built with a **production-oriented mindset**: modular, reusable, and scalable  
- Demonstrates **big data engineering** with PySpark pipelines  
- Includes **multiple ML approaches** with clear evaluation metrics  
- Shows the full process a Data Scientist executes in real companies  
- Designed as an **iterative project**, with regular improvements and extensions  
- Communicates strong ownership, technical depth, and applied knowledge
