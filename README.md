# Uruguay Census Big Data & Machine Learning Project

## Overview  
This repository contains an ongoing, end-to-end **data science project** built to explore, process, and model large-scale census data from **Uruguay** using **PySpark**.  
It is a work in continuous development, designed to showcase real-world skills in **big data processing**, **ML experimentation**, and **production-ready data pipelines**.

The goal is to demonstrate how I approach complex data problems from a full lifecycle perspective:  
**ingestion → cleaning → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → iteration.**
